                            I am a <strong>senior</strong> computer science and finance student at UT Austin.
                            While I am not sure what I plan to specialize in, I enjoy
                            building projects that allow me to learn about new subjects.

                            In my free time, I like to play pool, eat Thai food, and think about why I've
                            never seen a baby pigeon. I mean, they have to be out there somewhere, right?
