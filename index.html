                            Thanks for visiting my website! I'm <strong>Pranav Chandupatla</strong>, 
                            an aspiring developer.

                        <p>
                            I am a <strong>sophomore</strong> computer science and finance student at UT Austin.
                            While I am not sure what I plan to specialize in, I enjoy
                            building projects that allow me to learn about new subjects.
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            In my free time, I like to play pool, eat Thai food, and think about why I've
                            never seen a baby pigeon. I mean, they have to be out there somewhere, right?
